[@bevan2021] et al. present a central composite design in which they find inflorescence yield is not affected by potassium (K) concentration in the range of 60 - 240 mg $L^{-1}$

[@saloner2022] el al. present different results regarding potassium (K) supply on inflorescence yield, in which they find the optimum concentration to be 175 mg $L^{-1}$

[@stiles1914] introduce the antagonism between Ca and Mg and how
